<br>

[Verse 1]
    <br>
We're sitting on the floors
    <br>
I can't help but thinking that you're gonna watch my downfall
      <br>
Oh what an unfortunate affair
      <br>
It was an unfortunate affair
      <br>

  <br>
I'm sitting in the smoke covered room
      <br>
Against the bed I can't help but think
      <br>
That you're gonna watch my downfall
      <br>
Oh what an unfortunate affair
      <br>
It was an unfortunate affair
      <br>
      <br>



[Chorus]
      <br>
    Don't think you broke me I was broken already
      <br>
    Don't think I'm sensitive just know that my heart's heavier
      <br>
    than his, or hers, Oh how did this occur?
      <br>
    We were right for each other, right for each other
      <br>
      <br>
    
    [Verse]
    <br>
    Laying next to you, two bodies in a room
    <br>
    I can't help but think that you're gonna be my downfall
       <br>
    What an unfortunate affair
      <br>
  It was an unfortunate affair
      <br>
      <br>
    
    Laying in my bed, thoughts all in my head
    <br>
    I can't help but think that I'm gonna be my own downfall
    <br>
    Oh what an unfortunate affair
      <br>
It was an unfortunate affair
      <br>
      <br>
  
[Chorus]
      <br>
    Don't think you broke me I was broken already
      <br>
    Don't think I'm sensitive just know that my heart's heavier
      <br>
    than his, or hers, Oh how did this occur?
      <br>
    We were right for each other, right for each other
      <br>
      <br>
    
    [Bridge]
    <br>
    And I know I'm a sinner
    <br>
    And Lord knows I've been doing wrong
    <br> 
    And Those that call me a winner
    <br> 
    They just don't know what it cost
    <br>
    <br>
    
    [Chorus]
      <br>
    So don't think you broke me I was broken already
      <br>
    Don't think I'm sensitive just know that my heart's heavier
      <br>
    than his, or hers, Oh how did this occur?
      <br>
    We were right for each other, right for each other
      <br>
      <br>
    
    [Bridge]
    <br>
    And I know I'm a sinner
    <br>
    And Lord knows I've been doing wrong
    <br> 
    And those that call me a winner
    <br> 
    They just don't know what I've lost
    <br>
      <br>
      <br>
