<h1>In My Place</h1>

<p>
    
[Intro Verse]
   
     <br>
You like to make me feel small
     <br>
Walk around the room like a know it all
     <br>
And I can try, I'll try, I'll try to puff up my chest,
     <br>
and I would if I knew it  wasn't a waste of my breathe
     <br>
     <br>




[Chorus]
     <br>
You like to put me in my place
 <br>
To where I can't breathe from lack of space
 <br>
And I'll try,I'll try to push out as much as I can
 <br>
and I would if you weren't holding me in the palm of your hand
 <br>
     <br>


[Verse 1]
     <br>
Yeah I got bruises, I got scars
     <br>
Keep a shield around my broken heart
     <br>
I’ve gotten burned before I don’t fuck with you
     <br>
There’s about a million things that I would rather do
     <br>
You wanna fuck with me come on get in line
     <br>
Heard my name called bout a hundred thousand times
     <br>
Think you broke me and that I want you back
     <br>
Get over yourself and get over the fact
     <br>
That aint no way were getting back together
     <br>
Guess I was lying when I said forever
     <br>
So scoot to the left and get out of my way
     <br>
When they ask why were over I’ll sit back and say
     <br>
That you treated me wrong and that shit ain't fair
     <br>
Made me see things that were never really there
     <br>
You put me down just to bring yourself up
     <br>
Made me feel like I was never enough
     <br>
     <br>


[Chorus]
 <br>
You like to put me in my place
 <br>
To where I can't breathe from lack of space
   <br>
And I'll try,I'll try to push out as much as I can
     <br>
and I would if you weren't holding me in the palm of your hand
 <br>
 <br>
[Verse 2]
     <br>
They say Im elusive, exclusive, reclusive, conducive to situations
     <br>
Leather jacket bad girl in the making
     <br>
Steal whats yours like its for the taking
     <br>
Bass is loud, and the floors keep shaking
     <br>
Joint sittin pretty on bright red lips
     <br>
Feel the music from head to hips
     <br>
Got my girlies here with me and
     <br>
We don't need no guy, we be feeling fly
     <br>
This purse is prada, nails painted grabbing wine
     <br>
In fact without you I’d say im doing better
     <br>
Guess I was lying when I said forever
     <br>
So scoot to the left and get out of my way
     <br>
When they ask why were over I’ll sit back and say
     <br>
That you treated me wrong and that shit ain't fair
     <br>
Made me see things that were never really there
     <br>
You put me down just to bring yourself up
     <br>
Made me feel like I was never enough
     <br>
     <br>


[Chorus]
     <br>

You like to put me in my place
 <br>
To where I can't breathe from lack of space
 <br>
And I'll try,I'll try to push out as much as I can
   <br>
and I would if you weren't holding me in the palm of your hand
 <br>
 <br>

[Outro]
 <br>
You like to make me feel, make me feel, make me feel
 <br>
Small
 <br>
You like to make me feel, make me feel, make me feel
 <br>
Small
     <br>
     <br>
     <br>
     <br>
     <br>
