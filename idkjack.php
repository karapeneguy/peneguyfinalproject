[Intro]

A/C# D

     <br>

[Verse 1]
    <br>

You touch my me like my skin is poison
<br>
So scared to make a move
<br>
You got my body and mind rushing
<br>
I'll be blushing all the time when I'm with you
<br>
<br>

[Chorus]
    <br>

Get on top of me and
<br>
ride til the sun's rising
<br>
He's trying to love me I'm trying to feel again
<br>
He said come on over get on top my body
<br>
Feel the heat between these sheets as I kiss every part of your skin
<br>
I feel nothing at all,  I feel nothing at all

<br>
    <br>


[Verse 2]
    <br>

Shouldn't it  be easier than this
<br>
Should we turn all of this pain into bliss
<br>
Run around searching for happiness
<br>
As if we had the time
<br>
And I've lost feeling in so many ways
<br>
Numb to the minutes and numb to the days
<br>
Til you decided to put your body against mine
<br>
    <br>

[Chorus]
    <br>

Get on top of me and
<br>
ride til the sun's rising
    <br>
He's trying to love me I'm trying to feel again
    <br>
He said come on over get on top my body
                      <br>
Feel the heat between these sheets as I kiss every part of your skin
                <br>
I feel nothing at all,  I feel nothing at all
<br>
    <br>
[Bridge]
<br>                                        
Palms are sweaty, the bed is breaking you're crying out my name
    <br>
I was heaving and wheezing and rocking and seeing that nothing ever changes cause It's
<br>
Four a.m. and here I am out with another guy again
<br>
Sleepless night creaky floors I simply can not do this no more
<br>
    <br>
[Chorus]
<br>
Get on top of me and
<br>
ride til the sun's rising
 <br>
He's trying to love me I'm trying to feel again
      <br>
He said come on over get on top my body
                      <br>
Feel the heat between these sheets as I kiss every part of your skin
               <br>
I feel nothing at all,  I feel nothing at all

<br>
    <br>
[Chorus- Softer]
<br>
Get on top of me and
<br>
ride til the sun's rising
 <br>
He's trying to love me I'm trying to feel again
 <br>
He said come on over get on top my body
 <br>
Feel the heat between these sheets as I kiss every part of your skin
<br>
I feel nothing at all,  I feel nothing at all
    
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
